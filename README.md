# API EnHueco

### What is it?
**[EnHueco]** is an online system that allows university members (students and teachers) to share their weekly schedule information with other members of the community, so that they're able to plan work meetings, leisure time and any other activity together. 

This repository contains the DJango API that supports all mobile applications that make use of the platform. Currently it allows Android and iOS users to connect to the system using the REST protocol. The API is fully documented and can also be accessed using a web browser.
